What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

"git" file is copied as a hidden file in the repository folder so we can start keep tracking the different versions of the document. 

You need to do it if you want to keep control versions using git.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is a transition stage in a file to be commited. With this tool, you can add more than one file before to commit, and wrap up all related files to a change together.

That is important to avoid making more than 1 commit for the same logical change in different files.
